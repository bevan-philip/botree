        <h1>User Guide for Bo Tree</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Bo Tree! Bo Tree is a meditation and reflections app. It allows you to time your meditations, and to write some reflections following your experience. It can also remind you daily to perform your meditation, so you never forget.</p>

        <div class="main-screen" id="main-screen">
            <h2>Intro Screen</h2>
            <p>This is the intro screen for Bo Tree. </p>

            <p>At a glance: the top section of the screen is the timer. You can configure it to be whatever time you want using the up and down arrows. The left arrows change the total minutes, indicated by it's presence near the minutes section of the
            time. The right arrows change the total seconds in 5 second increments. Press on the arrow pointing to the right will start the timer.</p>

            <p>The ticker displaying the days indicates whether you have meditated on said day. It gives you a short term view of how you're doing, so you can track progress, but not be too bogged down by negative past experiences.</p>

            <p>Below the ticker, it shows a week-by-week overview of your meditations, including an average time meditated.</p>

        <div class="reflections" id="reflections">

            <p>In this screen, you can see the previous reflections, the content of them, and the time in which they were created. Press the left or right buttons at the top changes the currently displayed view, so you can view your meditations in the past (the exception being viewing into the future, as there's little point in this). You can also swipe left and right to do this.</p>

            <p>Pressing on the floating action button (FAB) allows you to create new reflections: this can also be performed from the post meditation screen, which we'll describe later.</p>
